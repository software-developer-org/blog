            Test Pyramid
        </h1>
        <p id = "tldr">
            For a software project to succeed you need a successful strategy to testing
            The test pyramid is a form of testing your software on differnet levels.
            It layers the testing to smaler parts of your projekt to simplify the process an makes it overall faster.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div id = "content">

            The test layers look like this:
<dl>

<dt>- 1. At the bottom are Unit Tests</dt>
<br>
<dd> These count for the majority of tests you have for your codebase. 
This tests the smallest unit of code possible, only test a single method each. This builds the foundation for further testing.
</dd>
<br>
<br>
<dt>- 2. Middle level consists of Integration Tests</dt>
<br> 
<dd>Which are tests designed to verify the integration of different parts of separate components of a software system together. 
This can be integration with a Database, with a Framework, with third party external software systems, or an API.

For example testing the getBlog() function in our project with the coresponding API call would be such an Integration test.
</dd>
<br>
<br>

<dt>- 3. At the top is the end-to-end tests</dt>
<br>
<dd>Which are tests that verifies the end to end workflows of your codebase. 
They tests the system from the user-action entry point right to the end of the system down to the database level. 
However, these are typically black-box tests that are mostly performed manually.
</dd>
<br>
<br>
</dl>

<h2>Test coverage:</h2>

<p>
You should Unit test all your functions and together with the Integration tests this makes 80% of your total test coverage.
The 20%	left is end to end testing that is still requiert to make shure your projekt works as intended.

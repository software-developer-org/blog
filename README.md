# Scope: blog app Solution
where I can post blogs and links on this site: https://taitruong.github.io/software-developer.org/

The blog and the data must be moved to:
- https://software-developer-org.github.io/blog

# Solution

There must be a dashboard area for members of software-developer.org:

Only members (user is logged in) can have access to the dashboard.

All stories (functional and technical requirements) are filed as [issues](https://github.com/software-developer-org/blog/issues).
